/**
 *
 * 1. - Single Responsibility principle. A function can do only one thing if
 * there is more than one reason to change it breaks the principle Also if the
 * name has the word And like printandsave.
 *
 * 2.- Open-Close principle. Application should take care of the frequent
 * changes. The design of the code would need to be that the changes can be
 * minimal when there are requirements. This can be achieved by: a) strategy
 * pattern b) template pattern
 *
 * 3.- Liskov Substitution principle. During development there is inheritance of
 * classes It would be great if the new derived class could work without
 * replacing the functionality of the other classes. Otherwise the new classes
 * produce undesired results when they are used in the existing program modules.
 * Child classes should never break the class parent definition. Subtypes must
 * be substitutable for their base type. The Child class can be replaced by the
 * parent class without affecting the functionality of the application. This can
 * be achieved by the use of template pattern.
 *
 * 4.- Interface segregation. We can have an abstraction of the system using
 * interfaces for example List<String> var = new ArrayList<>(). List<String> is
 * the interface and new ArrayList<>() is the implementation. Suppose that we
 * have an interface and we want to use only 2. However we need to implement all
 * of them. That is called "Fat Interface". The Interface segregation principle
 * states that no client should be forced to depend on methods that they don't
 * use. So we need to break them in smaller interfaces so they better satisfy
 * the needs of the client.
 *
 * 5.- Dependency Inversion principle. High level modules shouldn't depend on
 * low level modules We have to use a layer of abstraction between high level
 * and low level modules. 
 * 
 * High level <---> Abstraction Layer (Interfaces) <---> High level module. 
 * 
 * Abstraction Layer shouldn't depend on the low level
 * modules. - Creating an object of a class with new results in a class being
 * tightly couple to another class - Dependency inversion helps to create
 * loosely coupled modules - Modules should depend on abstraction In Object
 * Oriented Programming inversion of control can be implemented in several ways:
 * Using design patterns: factory, templates or strategy patterns. 
 * Using service locator pattern. 
 * Using dependency injection.
 *
 * -- DESIGN PATTERNS --
 * Design pattern is a general reusable solution or template to a commonly occurring problem in software design. 
 * The patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects.
 * 
 * Goal: 
 * Understand the problem and matching it with some pattern.
 * Reuse of old interface or making the present design reusable for the future usage.
 * 
 * 1) Creational - These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further 
 * categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use 
 * inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to 
 * get the job done.
 * Creational design patterns are: 
 * Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool, Prototype and Singleton.
 * 
 * Abstract Factory
 *  Creates an instance of several families of classes
 * 
 * Builder
 *  Separates object construction from its representation
 * 
 * Factory Method
 *  Creates an instance of several derived classes
 * 
 * Object Pool
 *  Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
 * 
 * Prototype
 *  A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
 * 
 * Singleton
 *  A class of which only a single instance can exist
 * 
 * 2) Structural - These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger 
 * structures and provide new functionality.
 * 
 * Structural design patterns are: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data 
 *
 * Adapter
 *  Match interfaces of different classes
 * 
 * Bridge
 *  Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
 * 
 * Composite
 *  A tree structure of simple and composite objects
 * 
 * Decorator
 *  Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
 * 
 * Facade
 *  A single class that represents an entire subsystem
 * 
 * Flyweight
 *  A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
 * 
 * Private Class Data
 *  Restricts accessor/mutator access
 * 
 * Proxy
 *  An object representing another object
 * 
 * 3) Behavioral - Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and 
 * realize these patterns.
 *
 * Behavioral patterns are Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, 
 * Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor
 * 
 * Chain of responsibility
 *  A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
 * 
 * Command
 *  Encapsulate a command request as an object
 * 
 * Interpreter
 *  A way to include language elements in a program
 * 
 * Iterator
 *  Sequentially access the elements of a collection
 * 
 * Mediator
 *  Defines simplified communication between classes
 * 
 * Memento
 *  Capture and restore an object's internal state
 * 
 * Null Object
 *  Designed to act as a default value of an object
 * 
 * Observer
 *  A way of notifying change to a number of classes
 * 
 * State
 *  Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
 * 
 * Strategy
 *  Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
 * 
 * Template method
 *  Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
 * 
 * Visitor
 *  Defines a new operation to a class without change

 * -- Strategy pattern -- 
 * 
 * Principle #1 Take what changes and encapsulate it. 
 * Separate code that changes <-------> code that stays the same.
 * Later you can change the parts that change without affecting the ones that don't
 * 
 * Principle #2 Program to an interface not an implementation.
 * Dog dog = new Dog(); // Not good; programming to an implementation
 * Animal dog = new Dog(); // Good programming 
 * Sometimes is easier to separate behavior from implementation: easier to reuse + we can add
 * different behavior without affecting the existing one.
 * 
 * Principle #3 Favor composition over inheritance. HAS-A relationship It gives you more flexibility
 * a) You can encapsulate stuff into their own classes
 * b) You can change behavior at run time using interfaces.
 * Inheritance IS-A relationship.
 * 
 * -- Observer pattern --
 * Defines a one to many dependencies -> if one object changes all its dependents are notified automatically
 * When two objects are loosely couple they can interact but they know little about each other.
 * The only thing the subject knows about the observer is that it implements a certain interface.
 * We can add observers whenever we want we just need to implement the observer interfaces
 * We don't have to modify the subject to add new type of observers.
 * We can independently use subjects or observers.
 * We can change the subject or observer independently.
 * 
 * -- Command pattern --
 * We can encapsulate method invocation, it encapsulates a request as an object
 * The object invoking the computation doesn't know about the implementation
 * There 4 components: command, receiver, invoker and client
 * 1) Command: knows about the receiver and invokes a method of the receiver, parameters
 * are part of the command.
 * 2) Receiver: does the work itself.
 * 3) Invoker: knows how to execute a command, and optionally does bookkeeping about the command
 * execution
 * 4) The client decides which commands to execute at which points to execute a command, it
 * passes the command object to the invoker.
 * 
 * -- Template --
 * In template pattern an abstract class exposes a defined way/template to execute its methods
 * The subclass can override the methods but the invocation needs to be as described in the abstract class
 * 
 * -- Null object pattern --
 * Motivation: reference may be null
 * It can be very elaborate to deal with null references
 * We have to check whether a reference is null or not -> NullPointerException if we call methods on null objects
 * Solution. The null pointer design. Create an abstract class specifying several operations to be done.
 * Concrete classes extending this class and a null object class providing "do nothing implementation"
 * 
 * -- Visitor --
 * Way to separate an algorithm from the object structure on within it operates.
 * As a result of this separation is the ability of adding new operations to existing object structures
 * without modifying those structures.
 * 
 * -- Single Pattern --
 * Restrict the instantiation of a class to a one single instance.
 * This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system
 * 
 * -- Factory pattern --
 * Helps to create loosely coupled OO design
 * We should not program to an implementation but to an interface, but every time we use new we do so.
 * In Java if we program to an interface our program will work for any class implementing that 
 * interface ( because of polymorphism ).
 * We have to find the part of our code that will change and separate it.
 * WE MAY ENCAPSULATE OBJECT CREATION.
 * 
 * -- Builder pattern --
 * If one application has a lot of parameters we would end up with telescopic constructor. With builder
 * we just add another method. 
 * Immutable property: The best is to use objects that can't be modified after they are created "Immutable objects".
 * This way won't be any concurrency problems when threads want to update them. 
 * 
 * -- Data Access Object pattern --
 * For instance when we are in the MVC and want to separate the module from the view
 * 
 * -- Decorator pattern --
 * Helps to make the Open-Closed principle come true. Open for extension closed for modifications.
 * Like Observer-Subject pattern.
 * It attaches additional responsibility to the object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative 
 * to sub classing for extending functionality.
 * For example. new LineNumberInputStream(new BufferedInoutStream(new FileInoutStream()));
 * 
 * -- Facade --
 * It provides an unified interface to a set of interfaces in the system.
 * It defines a high level interface that makes the system easier to use.
 * 
 * -- Adapter --
 * It converts an interface of a class into an interface that the user is expecting.
 * It enables classes together which couldn't otherwise because of the incompatibility.
 * 
 * -- Model View Controller --
 * Model - represents an object or a class carrying the data. It can also have logic to update
 * controller if the data changes.
 * Controller - acts on model and view. It controls the data flow to the model and updates the view
 * when the data changes.
 * View - represents the visualization of the data that the model contains.
 * MODEL <---> Controller <---> View <--->
 * 
 * -- Service Locator pattern --
 * It is for obtaining the processes involved in obtaining a service with a strong abstraction layer.
 * It is an alternative to dependency injection. We have a central registry called service locator.
 * Advantages: Allows code to be added at run time. It can make some optimization by deciding if there is
 * something better than the existing one like a better database library.
 * Disadvantages: It is like a black box and difficult to recover from errors. It gives run time errors.
