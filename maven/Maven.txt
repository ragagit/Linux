Maven provides default project structure. Assuming ${basedir} denotes the project location:

source code 		${basedir}/src/main/java
resources 		${basedir}/src/main/resources
Tests 			${basedir}/src/test
distributable JAR 	${basedir}/target
Complied byte code 	${basedir}/target/classes

In order to build the project, Maven provides developers options to mention life-cycle goals and project dependencies (that rely on Maven pluging capabilities and on its default conventions). 
Much of the project management and build related tasks are maintained by Maven plugins.

- POM

Maven requires JDK. pom.xml contains the goals and plugins.

Root element of POM.xml is project and it has three major sub-nodes

   <groupId>com.companyname.project-group</groupId>
   <artifactId>project</artifactId>
   <version>1.0</version>

All POMs inherit from a parent (despite explicitly defined or not). This base POM is known as the Super POM, and contains values inherited by default. 
An easy way to look at the default configurations of the super POM is by running the following command: mvn help:effective-pom.

- Build Lifecycle

A Build Lifecycle is a well defined sequence of phases which define the order in which the goals are to be executed.

A typical Maven Build Lifecycle consists of following sequence of phases

Phase 			Handles 		Description
prepare-resources 	resource copying 	Resource copying can be customized in this phase.
compile 		compilation 		Source code compilation is done in this phase.
package 		packaging 		This phase creates the JAR / WAR package as mentioned in packaging in POM.xml.
install			installation 		This phase installs the package in local / remote maven repository.

There are always pre and post phases which can be used to register goals which must run prior to or after a particular phase.
A goal represents a specific task which contributes to the building and managing of a project. It may be bound to zero or more build phases. 
A goal not bound to any build phase could be executed outside of the build lifecycle by direct invocation.

Maven has following three standard lifecycles:

    clean

    default(or build)

    site

- Build Profiles

A Build profile is a set of configuration values which can be used to set or override default values of Maven build. 
Using a build profile, you can customize build for different environments such as Production v/s Development environments.

Build profiles are majorly of three types
Type 		Where it is defined
Per Project 	Defined in the project POM file, pom.xml
Per User 	Defined in Maven settings xml file (%USER_HOME%/.m2/settings.xml)
Global 		Defined in Maven global settings xml file (%M2_HOME%/conf/settings.xml)

A Maven Build Profile can be activated in various ways.

    Explicitly using command console input.
    Through maven settings.
    Based on environment variables (User/System variables).
    OS Settings (for example, Windows family).
    Present/missing files.

- Maven Repository
In Maven terminology, a repository is a place i.e. directory where all the project jars, library jar, plugins or any 
other project specific artifacts are stored and can be used by Maven easily.

Maven repository are of three types

    local
    central
    remote

Maven local repository by default get created by Maven in %USER_HOME% directory.

Maven central repository is repository provided by Maven community. It contains a large number of commonly used libraries.
When Maven does not find any dependency in local repository, it starts searching in central repository using following URL: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/

Sometime, Maven does not find a mentioned dependency in central repository 
Maven will download dependency (not available in central repository) from Remote Repositories mentioned in the same pom.xml.
<dependencies>
      <dependency>
         <groupId>com.companyname.common-lib</groupId>
         <artifactId>common-lib</artifactId>
         <version>1.0.0</version>
      </dependency>
</dependencies>

- Plug-Ins

Maven is actually a plugin execution framework where every task is actually done by plugins.

mvn [plugin-name]:[goal-name]
mvn compiler:compile

Following is the list of few common plugins:
Plugin 		Description
clean 		Clean up target after the build. Deletes the target directory.
compiler 	Compiles Java source files.
surefire 	Run the JUnit unit tests. Creates test reports.
jar 		Builds a JAR file from the current project.
war 		Builds a WAR file from the current project.
javadoc 	Generates Javadoc for the project.
antrun 		Runs a set of ant tasks from any phase mentioned of the build.
