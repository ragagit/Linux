/*
Backbone.js organizes your code
Creates clean and efficient code
Based on MVC pattern
Models - Data
Views - Display
Controllers - Transfer data model to the view. Backbone doesn't have Controllers
Backbone has siz components:
    Models
    Views
    Collections, Javascript array
    Events
    Routers - Navigations
Javascript objects
Simple key/value pairs of JS methods & properties
You can create your own methids & properties
No mixed up code
No mixing JS into your HTML
Code is easier to mainatin & reuse
Backbone.js is a libtrary not a framework
Framework needs configuration.
Libraries have pre-built functions ready
Highly customizable
Most lightweight in Javascript MVC

- Setting up files
Modules
    A way of referring to single .js files
    Modules contain a particular piece of component code
    Modules make large codebase easier to read
    Modules are GREAT for team situations

- Watching for changes
Initialize() - Watches for changes
get() - find a specofoc model property
set() - change or add new properties to the model
on() - trigger the changes

- Views 
Contain the rukes for moving data into html
Views create templates thanks to Underscore
Youc an use other templates in Backbone
Use render() to build the HTML structure.
render() also sends model data to the web page
Model instance data gets stored in an article tag
Collection data gets stored in a section tag
